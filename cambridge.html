        <h2> The English Literature Student </h2>
          <p>I am reading a BA in English Literature at St. Edmund's College. At present, I am specialising in Postcolonial Literature and Chaucer. I am also writing a dissertation on Lebanese-American author, Khalil Gibran's representations of migration.</p>
        <h2> The Student Librarian (2017 - 2018)</h2>
          <p>I was the Student Librarian of my college from February 2017 to February 2018. During this time, I pushed for the diversification of our collection through acquiring more books written by BAME and LGBT+ authors. </p>
        <h2> The CR Welfare Officer (2018 - 2019) </h2>
          <p> I was the Welfare Officer of my college from February 2018 to 2019. This was huge challenge, but I've pulled through. As a result, I've also found a strength within me that I never knew I had!</p>
        <h2> The W1 Rower (2016 - 2018) </h2>
          <p>I rowed with the St. Edmund's College Women's Boat Club from November 2016 to June 2018. During this time, I took part in countless races and several Bumps campaigns. In addition, I attended many boat club dinners.</p>
